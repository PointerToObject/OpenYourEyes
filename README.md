Personal logs of my psychedelic experiences.

## 🌌 Unexplained Things

### 1. The Dream Switch  
Every time I take psychedelics, something flips in my brain — and suddenly, my dreams start running wild. Not just vivid, but intensely alive. Emotions, full conversations, entire plots. And no, not this “weed stops dreams” myth — that’s fake news. I dream like a motherfucker after a trip. It’s like the mushrooms oil up the dream machine and let it roar.

---

### 2. Memory Roulette  
On July 26th, I got hit with this surreal mental reboot. The trip unearthed entire memories I’d completely forgotten — like opening a drawer in my brain that hadn’t been touched in years. But here’s the weird part: afterward, people started showing up in my dreams who had nothing to do with those memories. Total strangers — or people from entirely different times in my life — were suddenly plugged into the scenes. Like my brain reconnected some long-lost cables… but did it wrong on purpose.

---

### 3. The Hair Phenomenon  
This one sounds like bullshit, but it’s real. After the July 26th trip, my hair went nuts — insanely curly, like it got hit with some divine humidifier. Nothing in my routine changed, no products. It was just… different. And I noticed it that night. I don’t know if it’s the oils in my scalp reacting or some trippy metabolic thing, but my hair transformed like it knew I was coming back from the other side.

---

### 4. The Stretching Instinct  
This part almost feels ritualistic. Anytime I take psilocybin, my body just starts stretching — no thought, no intention, just immediate full-body movement like I’ve trained for this my whole life. On July 26th, I even gave myself a deep core massage mid-trip — something I didn’t plan, just had to do. And the moment I did, it felt like my body said, “Thank you,” and let the trip go deeper. The more I stretched, the more powerful it got. Like unlocking levels in myself. Stretch, release, trip harder. Every. Single. Time.

## 🍄 Trip Log – 2g PB&J  
**Title:** The Mushrooms That Took a Nap

Two grams of mushrooms, pressed into a peanut butter and jelly sandwich like a secret ingredient in a lazy man’s potion. I took the bite expecting… something. What I got was the psychedelic version of “meh.”

There were a few swirls — little wisps of visuals teasing me in the corner of my eye — but nothing stuck. My body felt heavy, my eyelids heavier. I was high, sure, but not in that insightful way. It was like waiting at the gate of a theme park and never getting in.

Honestly, this isn’t a trip. It’s a day off. If you’re already high and want to drift deeper into chill vibes, maybe. But if you’re looking for answers, visions, or ego death — this ain’t it. It’s background noise. Mushrooms on mute.

## 🍵 2.5g Frozen Mushroom Tea Trip  
**Faster, stronger, weirder.**

I made a mushroom tea using 2.5 grams of B+ and froze it in a mason jar for later. About a week passed, and one night—bored and ready—I unfroze it and drank it.

The set and setting were perfect. I planned it because I knew I’d have nothing going on that night. Within six minutes, I felt it—like the psilocybin activated instantly in my stomach. Not even fifteen minutes in, my pupils were massive and I was already laughing.

I went to take a shower, and the moment I saw the shower head, something felt off. I thought it looked different. That’s when I knew—**I was tripping.** I took a nice long shower with light swirls dancing behind my eyelids.

After I dried off, I went to take some dabs.

### 🌈 Visual Shifts

Colors started changing. Yellow stood out more than any other—it had this subtle glowing hue to it that made it feel alive. I sat in my chair and took another dab, and then my eyes caught on the door. I’d never really just stared at it before.

The wood grain was swirling.

The walls started breathing. There was this faint RGB tone around the edges of everything. My perception wasn’t just altered—it was transforming. I laid down to see where the visuals would take me.

### 🌀 CEVs and Entities

With my eyes closed, I dropped into something deep. It began as a fuzzy purple and red space, kind of hard to see. It kept expanding and warping—stretching itself out—and then, suddenly, it all got clear.

I was inside some kind of strange room. Two weird Mayan-looking entities were there, morphing and moving around in impossible ways. Then the scene changed—random objects doing random things. No logic. No narrative.

Just psychedelic chaos.

Since I’ve done DMT, my psilocybin visuals have taken on this weird, unexplainable quality. They don’t make sense anymore. They don’t try to.

They just are.

**Hoping 3.15g gives me something even more clear.**

## 🌀 Trip Log – July 26, 2025 (3.09g Lemon Tek Tea)  
**Title:** July 26 — The First Day of Time

It started like most trips do — boredom. 5 PM. I was in my chair, doing dabs, killing time. Something pulled me toward the mushrooms. I cleaned the kitchen, boiled water, sliced a lemon. I made the tea with care, sat down with the cup in my hands. It always feels the same — like holding a one-way ticket. You sip, and you’re committed. No way back.

I drank half.

Twenty minutes passed. My body got heavy, my vision loose. The psilocybin had arrived, sneaky and smooth. I lit the nectar collector. The rosin hit — warm, thick, guiding. McKenna was right: weed isn’t just an enhancer. It’s a tool. A compass. It pointed inward.

I always shower while tripping. A ritual. The water hit me and my thoughts evaporated. Nothing but sound and stillness. The world stopped moving. I was present — not just in my body, but underneath it. Then the curtain started looking a bit… alien. Here we go.

I melted back into my chair, took another dab, and slipped deeper. Reality faded like mist. I felt primal. Ancient. Then came the urge: I had to stretch. Not optional. Couldn’t even think about it — my body took control. Deep, natural movements. Joints cracked, muscles loosened, core massaged. It was like the mushrooms knew exactly where the pain lived — and showed me how to let it go.

No phone. No music. No time. Just stretching, breathing, and falling further into the spiral.

And then, somehow, I forgot I was even tripping… and decided to eat more mushrooms. No taste, no hesitation. I ate three grams like they were sunflower seeds. Sat on the floor, eyes wide, giggling at nothing and everything. And then I laid down — and fell into the abyss.

I wasn’t tripping anymore. I was gone. There was no ceiling, no floor, no self. Only memory. The kind you don’t know you still have. I saw people I hadn’t thought of in years. Smelled old summers. Felt the textures of childhood. And then — I cried. Not sadness. Joy. Like the universe gave me back a missing piece of myself. I remembered that I was curious as a kid. Hungry to learn. And that’s what made me me.

I stood up and everything was alive. Not just visual noise — this was geometry. Sacred patterns. Breathing walls. Mayan art pulsing in the tapestry like a heartbeat.

I wandered into the bathroom. The light felt too bright, almost divine, and I found myself in front of the mirror. Usually, this is where it turns on me.

Normally, I tear myself down — hard. Every time I look, it’s the same routine:  
*You’re fat.*  
*Your arms are small.*  
*You’re not built enough. You’re soft.*  
It’s brutal. Constant. I nitpick everything — I don’t even give myself a chance. The mirror has always been a weapon.

But that night? Something else looked back.

I saw my veins, clear and defined. My shoulders looked broader. My muscles actually looked strong. And my hair — it had curled again, wild and alive like it was growing mid-trip. I stared at myself, expecting the usual voice to cut in… but it didn’t. All I felt was this deep, quiet pride.

Not the kind of pride that flexes. The kind that says, “Damn… maybe I was wrong about myself.”

I stood there, still, smiling — not like I beat the voice, but like it wasn’t even there to fight. For once, I didn’t see what was missing. I saw what was already there.

Back on the floor, I was pulled into a black hole. Everything flattened out. Colors shifted. I felt like time stopped. And in that moment, I knew — not believed, knew — that July 26th was the first day of Earth. Of time. Of existence.

It made sense in that space. Like everything I’d ever learned was just prep work for this moment. I realized that every person is just a fragment of the same being — and that being is God. All of us, broken into billions, wandering through our own stories. But today — July 26 — was when the story truly began.

I questioned war. Greed. Separation. Why do we fight, if we’re all the same? I couldn’t make sense of it. So I stopped trying. I surrendered to the day.

Later, I cleaned my space, smoked one last dab, and went to bed. July 27th, I woke up and said, without thinking:  
**“Hello, world.”**

I texted my boss. Put in my two weeks. Signed up for college. The trip was over, but the transformation stuck. Psilocybin didn’t just take me somewhere — it brought me back.

## 🍄 Trip Log – 1.5g Psilomart Nondetect legal mushrooms ( still avaliable online lmfao )  
**Told through psilocybin’s language — by Me**


### ☀️ A Quiet Sunday

It was a quiet Sunday. Bills? Paid. Dishes? Done. My space was clean, and for once, my mind was too. No obligations, no pressure—just a subtle feeling: *today might be different*.

I pulled out the scale. One gram of mushrooms didn’t feel like enough... so I tossed in a few extra caps. Roughly 1.5g. Crushed them, steeped them in warm tea with lemon, rolled a spliff while it brewed.

Then I stepped into my truck, cracked the windows, hit play on some 90s rock, sparked the joint.

The tea was earthy. The spliff grounded me. The sun was perfect. Everything clicked.


### 🌿 The Come-Up

Nine minutes in, that familiar body hum crept in—a squirmy, humming tension in the gut. Mushrooms letting me know something was shifting. I didn’t resist. I’ve learned not to.

I got out of the truck and went to my room. That’s when reality began to buckle.

The walls were breathing. Warm waves of euphoria pulsed through me. Colors warped into impossible purples, oranges, and greens—everything zig-zagged.

I lay down and closed my eyes.


### 👁️ Closed-Eye Realms & Gear People

Instantly, I was immersed in a realm of sacred geometry—vibrating grids, impossible shapes. Like DMT, but more gentle. Slower. Intentional.

When I opened my eyes again... I saw **them**:

**Gear People.**

Tiny, joyful, mechanical beings whirring and clicking in harmony. They were building everything. My room. My bed. The cup on my table—**all being constructed in real time** by these loving, organized entities.

> “This is it,” I thought. “I’ve stepped behind the curtain.”


### 🌑 The Void Speaks

Suddenly, the scene shifted.

I was watching a surreal alien vehicle drift across a 2D horizon. I was the driver. I was the camera. A glowing orb passed by.

I turned to look at it—and the world **exploded into sparkles**.

Now I was in the **void**.  
A black, endless nothing.

Entities moved like shadows, building and collapsing entire **realities** like sandcastles.

I asked:

- “Are you God?”  
  → *Yes.*

- “Am I intelligent?”  
  → *Yes.*

- “Who am I?”  
  → *...*

**Silence.**  
Then—snap.


### 💫 The Return

I was launched back into hyperspace—familiar territory I hadn’t visited since a strong DMT trip months ago. Everything was still made of the **Gear People**.

They smiled. They flowed. They worked.

They were **life** itself.

I opened my eyes and laughed. Only an hour had passed.  
> “This trip’s gonna be something special.”


### 🚿 Showers & Spliffs

The shower became **divine**. The curtain was alive, pulsing with fractals. Water turned holy. The steam shimmered. The Gear People? Still working—assembling droplets, weaving fabric, stacking particles.

Later, I climbed back into my truck, smoked again. The dashboard came alive. The odometer, the tachometer—every dial being rebuilt in front of me by joyful hands.

No questions this time. Just **awe**. Just **gratitude**.


### 🧠 The Realization

What stunned me most?

> These mushrooms were **legal**.

Ordered online. Delivered to my door.

Yet I:

- Spoke to **voids**
- Traversed **dimensions**
- Got answers to questions I didn’t even know I had

I didn’t find **everything**.

But I found **something**:

> **Who am I?**

That question was answered.

But another still lingers...

> **Why am I here?**


One day, I’ll return to find out.

Until then...  
The Gear People continue to build.
